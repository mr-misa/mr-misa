<h1>Hello! 🙋🏽‍♂️</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Misael, I go by Misa. Here on GitHub I am @mr-misa.</p>
<p>I am interested in anything that has to do with technology! Topics such as home automation, 3D printing, software development, and full stack web development are just a few of the items that peak my interest.</p>
<p>I am currently employed at Intel Corp. as a Manufacturing Systems Software Development Engineer.</p> 
<p>🎓 - I graduated from the University of Arizona in 2021 with a bachelor's degree in computer science.</p>
<p>📙 - I am currently in the process of learning and re-learning various programming languages, such as, PowerShell, Python, HTML, CSS, and JS.</p>
<p>My favorite programming languages are C# and Python for systems development. On the web development side my favorite is TypeScript!</p>
<p>I have never contributed to anything here on GitHub but I am looking forward to collaborating on projects related to web development.</p>
<p>On my free time I enjoy watching Sci-Fi shows and movies 🍿 🎬, trying new places to eat 😋, and spending time with my wife and our two dogs! 🐕</p>
